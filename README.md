### About me
I'm a backend developer, during my career I spent a lot of time developing chatbots where I had a lot of contact with python and JavaScript, and I ended up developing these skills for my current job as a backend developer. I'm always studying to improve my knowledge and skills as a developer, with a view to one day being an expert in my role.

My specialties include..

    - good communication
    - think outside the box
    - critical thinking about my work and that of my colleagues
    - good at working in teams
    - fast and efficient learning about new technologies and processes

- :scroll: Python, JavaScript, typescript
- :hammer_and_pick: Django, Django rest framework, Flask, FastAPI, NodeJs, Express, NestJs
- :wrench: Docker
- :wrench: PostgreSQL, MySql, MongoDB, Redis
